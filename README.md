# PastePurify
This is a tiny Chrome Extension that protects your from Clipboard XSS Attacks. It is minimal, experimental and does only do two things:

 * Display the content of the HTML Clipboard in Chrome (click the extension button after installing)
 * Sanitize the content or an HTML element after pasring content into it
  
**PLEASE NOTE:** This is an experimental mini-tool that is meant to demonstrate defensive capabilities of browsers and browser extensions when handling Clipboard XSS Attacks. It can certainly be bypassed and is not hardened. We did not test the effect on complex websites, we basically tested it on GMail. It's a demo tool for a conference talks and should be treated as such.

Use it on your own risk. But feel free to modify or fork in any thinkable way.
